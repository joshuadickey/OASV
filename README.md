The Open American Standard Version (OASV) is an open-source update to the venerable 1901 American Standard Version (ASV).

The 1901 ASV is a classic bible translation, long considered to be one of the most accurate translations in the English language. It is currently in the Public Domain, which means it is free to quote, reprint, copy and use for any purpose. Unfortunately, the language of the ASV is archaic and outdated, making it nearly inaccessible to the modern reader.

The OASV is nearly identical to the ASV in every way, including word order, punctuation and capitalization. This ensures that the OASV retains the same literal fidelity to the ancient scriptures. However, the language of the OASV has been significantly updated for modern readers, bringing this classic Bible to a new generation.

Importantly, the OASV is completely open-source. Not only is the full text is free to use, free to copy and free to print, but the entire methodology for producing the text can be duplicated by anyone: https://github.com/joshuadickey/OASV.

I pray that you benefit from reading, sharing and building upon this modern translation of the free and open Bible,

Dr. Joshua Thaxter Dickey
